- Merged PR #2 by @MarcChen: Ini project website 
This pull request sets up the initial structure for the Mawaqit Calendar website, including configuration, data, and deployment workflows. It introduces a Next.js 15 static site for displaying mosque information, complete with Tailwind CSS styling, ESLint setup, and automated Vercel deployments for both preview and production environments. The most important changes are grouped below:

**Deployment Automation**

* Added `.github/workflows/vercel-preview.yml` and `.github/workflows/vercel-production.yml` to automate Vercel deployments for preview (on pull requests) and production (on `main` branch pushes) for the `website` directory. These workflows build, deploy, and comment deployment URLs on PRs or log them for production.
